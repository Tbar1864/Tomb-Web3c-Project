                            The quiz is designed to be interactive and engaging, allowing you to test your understanding of the material in a fun way. A brief description of each 
                            assignment is provided below."<br> <br>
                            
                            "Assignment 1: The World Wide Web - This assignment focuses on the application of HTML and CSS in modern web design. It explores the role of HTML as the 
                            backbone of web content and details the history and foundational technologies of the World Wide Web (WWW). Invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 at CERN, 
                            the WWW emerged to address the need for global information-sharing. Berners-Lee’s innovations, including URLs, HTML, and HTTP, laid the foundation for the web. 
                            The report also highlights the significance of TCP/IP, developed in the 1970s, as the protocol enabling global computer communication. The growth of the WWW 
                            was marked by the creation of search engines, starting with Archie in 1990, and followed by Yahoo, AltaVista, and Google, which revolutionized information 
                            retrieval. The rise of search engines drove the development of social media, e-commerce, mobile technology, streaming services, and online education. 
                            Overall, search engine technology played a crucial role in transforming the WWW into an essential global resource, influencing numerous industries and shaping 
                            how people access and share information today."<br><br>

                            "Assignment 2: HTML/CSS - This assignment focuses on the application of HTML and CSS in modern web design. It explores the role of HTML as the backbone of 
                            web content, detailing its structure and elements. The report also highlights the significance of CSS in enhancing the visual presentation of web pages and
                            providing a consistent look and feel across different devices. It discusses the importance of responsive design, which allows web pages to adapt to various 
                            screen sizes and orientations, ensuring a seamless user experience. The report also emphasizes the role of CSS frameworks, such as Bootstrap and Foundation, 
                            in simplifying the design process and enabling developers to create visually appealing websites quickly. Additionally, it covers the use of CSS preprocessors 
                            like SASS and LESS, which extend CSS capabilities by introducing variables, nesting, and mixins, thus streamlining the development workflow. Overall, the assignment underscores the significance of HTML and CSS in modern web design, highlighting their roles in creating user-friendly and visually appealing websites.<br><br> 
                            allowing for customization. The assignment emphasizes the importance of understanding HTML and CSS for web developers,
                            as they are fundamental technologies for creating and styling web content." <br><br>
