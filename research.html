                            "<strong>Assignment 1: </strong>The World Wide Web - This assignment focuses on the application of HTML and CSS in modern web design. It explores the role of HTML as the 
                            backbone of web content and details the history and foundational technologies of the World Wide Web (WWW). Invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 at CERN, 
                            the WWW emerged to address the need for global information-sharing. Berners-Leeâ€™s innovations, including URLs, HTML, and HTTP, laid the foundation for the web. 
                            The report also highlights the significance of TCP/IP, developed in the 1970s, as the protocol enabling global computer communication. The growth of the WWW 
                            was marked by the creation of search engines, starting with Archie in 1990, and followed by Yahoo, AltaVista, and Google, which revolutionized information 
                            retrieval. The rise of search engines drove the development of social media, e-commerce, mobile technology, streaming services, and online education. 
                            Overall, search engine technology played a crucial role in transforming the WWW into an essential global resource, influencing numerous industries and shaping 
                            how people access and share information today."<br><br>

                            "<strong>Assignment 2: </strong>The report analyzes the "Band Template" from w3schools.com, highlighting its clean, simple, and responsive design. 
                            The template includes a navigation bar, a slideshow, and sections with default content like images, paragraphs, and forms. The HTML code is well-organized, 
                            with comments for clarity, though it sometimes over-nests `<div>` elements, which could affect performance and accessibility. The template uses external and 
                            inline CSS for styling and incorporates some external fonts. However, it lacks semantic HTML5 tags and ARIA elements, which limits its accessibility, especially 
                            for assistive technologies. The report suggests that updating the template with HTML5 tags and ARIA would improve accessibility. Overall, the template is effective 
                            as a base but requires adjustments for better accessibility." <br><br>
                                                       
                            "<strong>Quiz: </strong>The quiz is designed to be interactive and engaging, allowing you to test your understanding of the material in a fun way." <br><br>
