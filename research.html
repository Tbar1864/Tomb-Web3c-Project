                        <p>"For research, I completed two class assignments. The first on the World Wide Web and understanding the historical and foundational technologies related to it. 
                            The second on analyzing the application of HTML/CSS in modern web design.<br>
                            I also created a quiz page to test your knowledge of the topics covered in the assignments.
                            The quiz is designed to be interactive and engaging, allowing you to test your understanding of the material in a fun way.<br>
                            A brief description of each assignment is provided below. <br>

                            The World Wide Web - The report details the history and foundational technologies of the World Wide Web (WWW). Invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 at CERN, 
                            the WWW emerged to address the need for global information-sharing. Berners-Leeâ€™s innovations, including URLs, HTML, and HTTP, laid the foundation for the web. 
                            The report also highlights the significance of TCP/IP, developed in the 1970s, as the protocol enabling global computer communication. The growth of the WWW 
                            was marked by the creation of search engines, starting with Archie in 1990, and followed by Yahoo, AltaVista, and Google, which revolutionized information 
                            retrieval. The rise of search engines drove the development of social media, e-commerce, mobile technology, streaming services, and online education. 
                            Overall, search engine technology played a crucial role in transforming the WWW into an essential global resource, influencing numerous industries and shaping 
                            how people access and share information today.<br><br>
