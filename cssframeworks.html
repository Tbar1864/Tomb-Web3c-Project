                            <p>"<strong>PROJECT DEPENDENT:</strong>What framework is right for you?"<br> <br> It often depends on the 
                                project requirements. Some projects may need a more responsive site that loads quickly, while other projects may require 
                                more customization. Figuring out which framework works best for your project is often about finding the right balance to meet 
                                your specific needs. There are many CSS frameworks to choose from and each with differing strengths and weaknesses. Choosing 
                                the right CSS framework for your web project can be a game-changer (Best CSS Frameworks 2024 Compared, n.d.). <br> <br>

                                <strong>INTRO: Focus Areas When Choosing the Right CSS Framework</strong>  <br> <br>
                                1. <strong>Performance</strong>: How fast does the framework load? Does it have a large file size? <br> <br>
                                2. <strong>Customization</strong>: How easy is it to customize the framework? Does it have a lot of built-in components? <br> <br>
                                3. <strong>Community Support</strong>: How large is the community around the framework? Are there a lot of resources available? <br> <br>
                                4. <strong>Learning Curve</strong>: How easy is it to learn the framework? Is it beginner-friendly? <br> <br>  
                                5. <strong>Feature Set</strong>: How feature rich is the framework? <br> <br>

                                <strong>CSS Frameworks:</strong>Based on my initial research, it is obvious that choosing the right framework for your web project 
                                is important. The right CSS framework could significantly impact the project’s development and overall design consistency. For 
                                comparison, I chose two popular CSS frameworks – Bootstrap and Bulma. Each have their strengths and weaknesses, but both are used 
                                widely and have a strong community support. <br> <br>

                                <strong>BOOTSTRAP</strong> <br> <br>
                                <strong>Performance - </strong>Bootstrap relies on a smart layout system that works on all devices. To help speed things up, bootstrap keeps 
                                the files small. Core features include a responsive grid system with pre-designed components like forms, buttons, and navigation. Popular 
                                framework for building responsive, mobile-first websites. <br> <br>
                                <strong>Customizable - </strong>There are many things that you can change in Bootstrap providing many options for customizing it 
                                to the way that you want. You can make changes to the style of the design elements like buttons and menus to get a desired look 
                                and feel. Even with these many options, some believe that it is a little rigid for greater changes. <br> <br>
                                <strong>Community Support - </strong>Bootstrap is still very popular, and millions of websites use it. There is a large community of 
                                experienced users that will often provide help with questions.
                                <strong>Learning Curve - </strong>Bootstrap is a user-friendly framework that is easy for beginners. The code is simple and easy to learn. The documentation 
                                is extensive and includes a lot of examples for learning. <br> <br>
                                <strong>Feature Set - </strong>Bootstrap is feature rich. It includes features like a grid system for laying out your page, and ready-to-use components like 
                                buttons and navigation bars. It is responsive for smaller screens like phones and tablets and is supported by many different web browsers. 
                                Bootstrap includes tools for improving text styles and adding animations. <br> <br>
