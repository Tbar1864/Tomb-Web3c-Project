                            <p>"<strong>PROJECT DEPENDENT:</strong> What framework is right for you?"<br> <br> It often depends on the 
                                project requirements. Some projects may need a more responsive site that loads quickly, while other projects may require 
                                more customization. Figuring out which framework works best for your project is often about finding the right balance to meet 
                                your specific needs. There are many CSS frameworks to choose from and each with differing strengths and weaknesses. Choosing 
                                the right CSS framework for your web project can be a game-changer (Best CSS Frameworks 2024 Compared, n.d.). <br> <br>

                                <strong>INTRO: Focus Areas When Choosing the Right CSS Framework</strong>  <br> <br>
                                1. <strong>Performance</strong>: How fast does the framework load? Does it have a large file size? <br> <br>
                                2. <strong>Customization</strong>: How easy is it to customize the framework? Does it have a lot of built-in components? <br> <br>
                                3. <strong>Community Support</strong>: How large is the community around the framework? Are there a lot of resources available? <br> <br>
                                4. <strong>Learning Curve</strong>: How easy is it to learn the framework? Is it beginner-friendly? <br> <br>  
                                5. <strong>Feature Set</strong>: How feature rich is the framework? <br> <br>

                                <strong>CSS Frameworks:</strong>Based on my initial research, it is obvious that choosing the right framework for your web project 
                                is important. The right CSS framework could significantly impact the project’s development and overall design consistency. For 
                                comparison, I chose two popular CSS frameworks – Bootstrap and Bulma. Each have their strengths and weaknesses, but both are used 
                                widely and have a strong community support. <br> <br>

                                <strong>BOOTSTRAP</strong> <br> <br>
                                <strong>Performance - </strong>Bootstrap relies on a smart layout system that works on all devices. To help speed things up, bootstrap keeps 
                                the files small. Core features include a responsive grid system with pre-designed components like forms, buttons, and navigation. Popular 
                                framework for building responsive, mobile-first websites. <br> <br>
                                <strong>Customizable - </strong>There are many things that you can change in Bootstrap providing many options for customizing it 
                                to the way that you want. You can make changes to the style of the design elements like buttons and menus to get a desired look 
                                and feel. Even with these many options, some believe that it is a little rigid for greater changes. <br> <br>
                                <strong>Community Support - </strong>Bootstrap is still very popular, and millions of websites use it. There is a large community of 
                                experienced users that will often provide help with questions.
                                <strong>Learning Curve - </strong>Bootstrap is a user-friendly framework that is easy for beginners. The code is simple and easy to learn. The documentation 
                                is extensive and includes a lot of examples for learning. <br> <br>
                                <strong>Feature Set - </strong>Bootstrap is feature rich. It includes features like a grid system for laying out your page, and ready-to-use components like 
                                buttons and navigation bars. It is responsive for smaller screens like phones and tablets and is supported by many different web browsers. 
                                Bootstrap includes tools for improving text styles and adding animations (Best CSS Frameworks 2024 Compared, n.d.). <br> <br>

                                <strong>BULMA</strong><br> <br>
                                <strong>Performance - </strong>Making websites run quickly and smoothly is Bulma’s primary objective. Utilizing CSS Flexbox for laying out and arranging items on the page 
                                improves on the speed. Including only the necessary bits of CSS helps keep file sizes at a minimum. Bulma also ensures that pictures don’t load all at 
                                once to avoid a slow loading website. Bulma’s primary focus is speed. <br> <br>
                                <strong>Customizability - </strong>Bulma is perfect for those that like to tweak things. Built on a platform that only lets you use the parts you need it still provides the capability to 
                                change the look of almost everything. Simple color and font changes can be made directly in CSS or for more detailed changes by using the advanced feature called Sass 
                                variables. Adding new elements or adjusting things is easy and straightforward. <br> <br>
                                <strong>Community Support - </strong>Bulma is an open-source project with strong community support. Many people that are supportive of Bulma are active on Stack Overflow and Github and will often 
                                provide answers to questions. The support is reliable while there may not be as many available guides and tutorials. <br> <br>
                                <strong>Learning Curve - </strong>Bulma is simple and easy to get started using. Because it uses simple CSS classes that makes sense, it is easy to learn it quickly. Bulma is user friendly for beginners and 
                                even easier for anyone with a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. <br> <br>
                                <strong>Feature Set - </strong>Bulma comes with many options for creating your webpage. Included are options for organizing your page, 
                                like columns and ready to use features like buttons and forms. It is supported by all major browsers and is responsive for smaller mobile device screens. It does require 
                                additional tools to support things that move or react with JavaScript interactions (Best CSS Frameworks 2024 Compared, n.d.). <br> <br>

                                "This is a brief comparison of two popular CSS frameworks amoung several. Both Bootstrap and Bulma are popular amoung web developers and 
                                both have their strengnths and weaknesses. For a deeper dive into both Bootstrap and Bulma, use the link below to access the full pdf version of my research."</p>
