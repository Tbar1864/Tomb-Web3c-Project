                            <h3>"Analysis of the Application of HTML/CSS in Modern Web Design"</h3>
                            
                            <p>For this project, I am analyzing the webpage template “Band Template” available at w3schools.com. This template is a very 
                                nice example template detailing a fictitious band. I like the webpage template and find it very appealing and organized. 
                                The layout is clean and simple making it easy to use and navigate. The Home page is visually appealing and interesting and 
                                includes a short slide show that is looped with a single band-oriented picture each labeled with location Los Angeles, 
                                New York and Chicago. The webpage template layout is clean and responsive and not overly complex. It includes a tabular 
                                navigation bar at the top for Home, Band, Tour, Contact and More for effectively directing the website visitor to those 
                                specific sections of the webpage. Each section of the website template includes default pictures, paragraphs, forms and 
                                labels to illustrate each sections focus (W3Schools.com, n.d.). <br><br>

                                Viewing the template in a browser proved it to be responsive when scrolling or navigating through the tabs. The More tab 
                                included 3 additional subtabs that were dead and obviously used as placeholder examples for the template. After inspecting 
                                the template code, it appears to be well organized and complete. The head element includes sufficient data defining the title, 
                                character sets, stylesheets and metadata. The head element is in the correct location between the <html> tag and the <body> 
                                tag. The body element correctly follows the </head> tag and encapsulates all the contents of the template. HTML comments are 
                                peppered throughout the body providing details about each section of the template. The body includes a footer element
                                which is used to display social media platform badges and includes a working link to w3schools.com at the bottom of the 
                                webpage template (W3Schools.com, n.d.). <br><br>

                                The webpage template added CSS using external and inline CSS to achieve the desired style of the website template. In the 
                                head element, the template links to a w3schools CSS stylesheet using the link tag 
                                <link rel="stylesheet” href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/4/w3.css”> in the head element. In addition, links to Google 
                                and Cloudflare stylesheets are used for additional fonts. Inline CSS is used throughout using the “style” attribute of the 
                                relevant element. For example, under the Band section, the style=”width: 60%” is used to reduce the size of the default band 
                                member image so the 3 default band images fit nicely inline on the webpage (W3Schools.com, n.d.). <br><br>

                                The webpage template tends to over-nest the “div” element at times breaking the rule of best practice of keeping the HTML 
                                structure simple. Over nesting may negatively impact a site’s performance and accessibility which may occur if using this 
                                template. It is always best practice to avoid over nesting making the HTML code harder to read and maintain. Except for the 
                                footer tag, very few HTML5 tags are used within the website template. The lack of Symantec HTML5 tags impacts the ability for 
                                users and search engines to navigate and understand the web content (Hernandez, 2024). <br><br>

                                I found the webpage template appealing and effective as a base template. Updating the code using HTML5 tags will improve on 
                                the website accessibility. Using the WAVE web accessibility evaluation tool, it identified multiple issues with alternative 
                                text, form labels, link data, contract, structural, and feature errors. And WAVE identified that it lacked any ARIA 
                                (Accessibly Rich Internet Applications) elements limiting the template’s ability to support assistive technologies. If the 
                                template included Symantec HTML5 tags, the lack of ARIA would be acceptable since it provides the accessibility feature for 
                                users that require assistive technology. Using this template will require some editing to improve on accessibility, but 
                                overall, the layout and functionality is very nice (WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools, n.d.). <br><br>
